# MobWeb_HideNonFreeShipping extension for Magento

This Magento extension hides all non-free shipping methods if a free shipping method is available.

A lot of stores offer free shipping if an order exceeds a certain total amount. Unfortunately, your "normal" non-free shipping methods are still displayed alongside the free shipping method. This extension automatically hides the non-free shipping methods should a free shipping method be available.

## Installation

Install using [colinmollenhour/modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman/).

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
